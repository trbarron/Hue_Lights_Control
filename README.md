## Hue Lights Control

This is a project to give myself more control over the lights in my apartment.

Features:
- Wakes you up with lights turning on. Lights correspond to the day's forecasted weather
- Uses Amazon Dash buttons scattered through the house to turn on/off all the lights in the apartment
- Uses MPC Drum pad to control light scenes that shift through configurable color pallets and timings
- All color schemes and brightnesses are settable by a spreadsheet that shows the expected color and exports to the correct format
